    "The objective of this TuTorial is to get you to write a **modern** Variational Monte Carlo code yourself, that you understand how it is built, such that you can become a great scientist in the future and build upon this new knowledge.\n",
    "To do that, we will pick a simple problem: the 2D Transverse-Field ising Model and we will try to compute its ground-state, and later on, we will try to simulate a quench. \n",
    "For your information, regardless of what people say those days, the 2D Transverse Field Ising model's ground state at the critical point (and around) can be determined with relatively simple VMC ansatze to almost numerical precision on lattices in excess of hundreds of sites with a reasonable cost (~half a day on a GPU for ~8x8, a few extra GPUs on larger lattices). \n",
    "For the 16 sites you're playing with today you should expect simulations that run in few seconds for simple networks, and ~minute(s) for more complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code wise, I'm a fan of **efficient** research. I think you can write a VMC code in C/++ or Rust and handwritten CUDA (note below), and if you're telling me that, you are surely capable of doing that. However nowdays, I prefer to be able to prototype an algorithm in 10 minutes, and let my GPU do some extra work for me, see that the algorithm does not work, and prototype the next algorithm in 10 minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: recently Andrej Karphathy reimplemented GPT-2 in handwritten C++ and CUDA, and achieved a factor of 10 speedup over PyTorch... so there's value in handwriting things. But only if you know exactly what you want to implement! That code is an unreadable mess, and it's leveraging architecture-specific optimisations, and you cannot change the network architecture at all https://x.com/karpathy/status/1795484547267834137 )\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to show you that you can write **simple implementations** of many algorithms that are efficient, and you can build upon that.\n",
    "The main building block will be Automatic Differentiation, which can at times be a bit counter-intuitive, but which is extermely powerful!\n",
    "To avoid spending time on some 'tough' points that are technically challenging but which have no intrinsic physical interest, we will be building upon the open source package we develop, [NetKet](https://www.netket.org/) .\n",
    "In particular, the things that will be taken from NetKet are:\n",
    " - The Monte Carlo samplers: because writing one is not fun, but it is not hard either. If you want, you can reimplement them over the weekend!\n",
    " - The operators: Writing an efficient implementation of (arbitrary) sparse operators that can efficiently be indexed in a way that is relevant to VMC is again not straightfoward, and very error prone. I don't want you to spend time thinking about that today. Instead, we will use them as a 'black box' with a well defined interface. Our implementation is very easy to use and flexible, but again, you're free to reimplement it however you want in the future! It will just take you a few sleepless nights and many cups of coffee.\n",
    " - Complex value Automatic Differentiation fixes: AD in Pytorch does not work with complex numbers, while in Jax it does some funny, counter intuitive things (counter intuitive for physicists. Computer scientists will tell you that it makes perfect sense). We will be re-using some AD primitives from netket that make it more straightforward to work with complex numbers and translate the formulas on the blackboard to code, but if you're curious about what happens under the hood and why we need to do that, ask me!\n",
